# Power-BI-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard
**Summary**
This project involved analyzing a company's sales dataset in Power BI. The process included connecting and transforming the dataset in Power Query, creating necessary columns, and using DAX measures to answer key business questions. The final dashboard featured visualizations such as KPI cards displaying revenue, profit, and cost, as well as charts showing monthly and yearly sales, top products, customers, and regions.

**Steps Involved:**

**Data Connection and Transformation:**

- I connected to the sales dataset using Power BI's Power Query Editor, where I performed data cleaning and transformation. This included merging tables, removing unnecessary columns, and creating new columns that were essential for the analysis. Data transformation also involved formatting data types, handling missing values, and ensuring that the dataset was structured correctly for further analysis.
  
**DAX Measures and Calculated Columns:**

- Using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), I created calculated columns and measures to derive important metrics, such as total revenue, profit margins, and costs. These DAX measures were crucial for answering specific business questions and performing in-depth analysis. Calculated columns were created to segment data by various dimensions such as product categories, customer demographics, and regions, enabling more granular analysis.
  
**Dashboard Creation:**
- I designed a comprehensive dashboard that included various visualizations to present the analyzed data effectively:

- KPI Cards: The dashboard featured top-level KPI cards displaying key metrics such as total revenue, profit, and cost. These provided a quick and clear overview of the company's financial performance.

- Sales Trends: I included line charts to visualize monthly and yearly sales trends, allowing stakeholders to track performance over time and identify seasonal patterns or growth trends.

- Top Products, Customers, and Regions: Bar charts and tables highlighted the top-performing products, most valuable customers, and highest-grossing regions. These insights helped in understanding where the company was excelling and where there might be opportunities for growth.

**Insights and Business Impact:**

The analysis provided clear visibility into the company's sales performance, highlighting key areas of success and potential improvement. By identifying top products, customers, and regions, the company could better allocate resources and tailor its strategies to maximize profitability.
The combination of DAX measures and Power BI's visualization capabilities allowed for a deep, insightful analysis that was both accessible and actionable for stakeholders.
